## Firebase Hosting 🔥
Firebase Hosting allows fast and secure hosting for our web application, static and dynamic content, and microservices. It is production-grade web content hosting for the developers. We can easily and quickly deploy web apps and serve both static and dynamic content to a global content delivery network with only a single command. We can pair Firebase Hosting with Cloud Function for building and hosting microservices on Firebase. 

Firebase Hosting, by default, provides an SSL certificate and offers an impressive speed across several geographical locations without any requirement for a separate CDN on top

*The Web Application has been deployed via Firebase Hosting*
